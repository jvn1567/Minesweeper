# Minesweeper
This program runs a basic minesweeper game in JavaFx. The user can specify the size of the game area and how many mines to place.

Minesweeper is a game where the player is given a grid of tiles that may contain mines. Clicking on a tile with a mine results in a loss, while clicking on safe tiles reveals the number of mines in the neighboring 8 tiles. The player can right click to flag a tile they believe contains a mine. The game is won when only tiles containing mines remain.
